								<p class="article--p__roboto">
The Style Guide is a living document which details the elements and components of the customer facing experience. Beyond its use in consolidating the front-end code, it also documents the visual language, such as header styles and color palettes, used to create the site. Becoming a visual resource for the entire team - from product owners and producers to designers and developers to refer when discussing site changes and iterations.

The Style Guide allows us to standardize the CSS, keeping it small and quick to load. By using the guide as an inventory of modules and code, both designers and developers can quickly see if new designs deviate from established standards, and decide as a team if it's worth expanding the codebase or if something already written is easily extended.

As the team grows and changes over time, the Style Guide will help stablize consistency. Creating the guide will take some time up front, but I've found that this pays off with faster build times for new sections and pages, because anyone joining an ongoing project can refer to the guide for the exact styles to use.

Design consistency is easier to maintain, as the designer can look in one place to reference the site's components and ensure a cohesive look and feel throughout. This is especially helpful on larger teams and at enterprise-level companies where you may have an entire team of designers working on the site. And when design consistency is maintained, the codebase is also kept smaller.

We should strive to write clean, maintainable code that focuses on future-proofing. Living style guides tend to encourage such a workflow and aide in making developers and customers alike much happier.
