The living style guide is a collection of design patterns, components, and guidelines for creating a unified UX. It provides access to the core visual and interaction design patterns so that you can follow established best practices and build experiences that have a consistent look and feel. It makes doing the right thing also the easiest thing. Here we define our styles using code. They are flexible. The intent is for them to evolve to our needs, quickly.
